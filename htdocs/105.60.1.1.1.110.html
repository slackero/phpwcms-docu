      Hi there! <br />
I didn’t want to waste any more time teasing her either, though. Instead, when I went down for what she thought would be another tantalising lick, I ran my lips as well as my tongue over her pussy, stretching the muscles in my jaw to try and encompass as much of her as I could. With my mouth clamped over her private parts like a suction cup, I settled down and began to eat. I tried just about everything I could think of; I stuck my tongue as far up her vaginal passage as I could, I took the loose skin on her clitoral hood into my mouth and sucked it out over and over again, I delved so deep and hard that my nose was pushed into her passage.  I inhaled again - always inhale, I told myself flippantly. <br />
 <br />
I don’t know how much of what I did was me trying to imitate something I’d seen in porn, but it seemed to work. Holly settled down into a pattern of soft, subdued moans which made me tingle inside, punctuated by an occasional sharper cry when I switched to something different. She held my head firmly in place, running her fingers through my hair, and that sensation was doing good things to me as well. <br />
I love <strong>***</strong> :) <br />
Young  lolita it is a best !!! <br />
